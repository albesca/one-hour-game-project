A game where different objects appear on screen and the player must click on the right ones and avoid the wrong ones.
The objects stay on screen for a fixed time, then disappear.
Each time a correct object disappear the player lose a life.
Each time the player clicks on a wrong object the player lose a life.
The player starts with three lives.
The first ten objects appear every five seconds and last for ten seconds.
After that the spawn rate decrease by a second and the lifespan decrease by two seconds every ten objects.
When the spawn rate goes to zero (fifty objects) the player wins.
The correct (target) object is shown at the bottom of the screen.
After each new object spawns there's a chance (1/5) that the target object changes.
Each correct guess (click or ignore) gives a point.
